# OOP Course - Excercise 3 - Ariel University 2020
#### This is excercise 3 in Object Oriented Programming course, which is an implementation of a directed weighted graphs in Python,  
and comparing the algorithms we wrote in Java to the ones we wrote in Python, and then comparing both to NetworkX library in Python.

### General info
This structure is capable of creating directed weighted graphs, and using a few algorithms on them:

- Check if a graph is strongly connected
- Find all the connected components of the graph
- Find the connected component of a specified node
- Find the shortest path between 2 nodes and its length
- Save and load a graph from a file using JSON format

---

### Dependencies
this project is using:
- matplotlib 3.3.3
- NetworkX 2.5
- numpy 1.19.5

---

### Comparison
I have compared the running time of these 3 functions:
- shortest_path
- connected_component
- connected_components  

the results are in the PDF file, as well as the entire Excel spreadsheet in the xlsx file.
